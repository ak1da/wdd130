            <p>Nigeria is a diverse and populous country located in West Africa, known for its rich cultural heritage, ethnic variety, and economic significance. With over 200 million people, it is the most populous country in Africa and features more than 250 ethnic groups, including the Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo. Nigeria's landscape ranges from the arid Sahel in the north to tropical rainforests in the south, and it is rich in natural resources, especially oil and gas. Its economy is one of the largest in Africa, though it faces challenges such as political instability, corruption, and infrastructure issues. Despite these, Nigeria remains a vibrant nation with a growing tech scene, influential music and film industries (notably Nollywood), and a strong sense of national pride.</p>
