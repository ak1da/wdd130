            <!-- <h2>History</h2> -->
            <p>Founded many years ago, our rafting company started with a passion 
               for rivers and the thrill of the outdoors. Over time, we have grown
               into a trusted name, offering unforgettable experiences for families
               and adventure seekers. What began as a small team with a love for 
               whitewater has become a community of skilled guides and outdoor 
               enthusiasts dedicated to sharing that same passion with others. 
               Today, we take pride in combining experience, safety, and fun, 
               creating adventures that bring people closer to nature and to each 
               other. Our legacy is built on countless smiles, lifelong memories, 
               and the belief that every trip down the river is a new story waiting 
               to be written.
